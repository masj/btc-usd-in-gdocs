This is a ticker macro for google docs.

If you want to use live bitcoin->USD exchange rates in your google document, you can use this macro. Currently written for USD rates but can easily be modified for Euro or any other currency.

It can fetch the rate from bitfloor, bitpay or mtgox. It will cache the rate to avoid hitting the servers repeatedly.

Usage instructions can be found in ticker.js
